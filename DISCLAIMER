## Be Prepared for Death Threats, or Worse

We strongly believe that bravery is the heart of an honest society,
however you should be aware that many people harm each other all
the time for holding opposing beliefs. We believe that bravery can
help combat this, but there is no substitute for ample physical
protection; __you are on your own__ to decide how you accomplish
your own physical safety, and __this application may put you at
greater risk__! Please be aware, careful, and prepared to protect
yourself against anyone harmful that may come your way.

If someone is attempting to harm you, __call 911 or your local
authorities__! We do not condone vigilantism or obstruction of
justice, only peaceful debate. However, many people cannot concieve
such a concept, and will attempt to harm or silence those that
challenge their belief systems. This is not only wrong, it is
illegal under U.S. federal law (source?). Please be prepared to
protect yourself physically, and issue requests for protection from
your local authorities when necessary. Please seek their official
counsil for more details on when it is acceptable to request their
protection. Thank you.
